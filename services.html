                      Through consultation, collaborative development, and training, 
                      I assist in the design and implementation of programs that intend to motivate change.

                        The most effective way to re-design programs is to assess current practices to identify strengths,
                         weaknesses, and where efforts should be directed. Once this information has been collected and
                          analyzed, offering targeted training through workshops for your staff will build capacity.
                           This allows your staff to implement changes with high efficacy and bridges the design-implementation
                            gap that often exists in these settings. Finally, designing programs that incorporate 
                            the findings of the assessment, as well as theoretical and applied behavioral models, 
                            will greatly enhance the success of your programs. This success will be measurable and
                             will be a value-add to your institution – donors and funders want to see how their 
                             support impacts the community & wildlife. I offer all three of these services as a 
                             package (recommended) or individually to meet your needs. Please <a href ="contact.html">Contact Me</a> to learn more.

                           how the program was designed and how it really looks in practice is key to
                            addressing design-practice gaps.

What is the goal of the program?
How is the goal intended to be achieved? How is it being approached (strategy)? What theory(ies) supports the strategy?
What applied tools are being used to achieve the goal?
How are staff being trained to deliver the program?
